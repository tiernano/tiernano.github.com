title: PowerShell, Git and SSH Stuff
---

So, I use both Windows and Mac on a daily basis, and though some of these tips for using PowerShell and Git, and also SSH tips, may be handy.

* this [post][1] on Ramblins of the Sleepy... talks about using PowerShell with everything, including Git. Got it up and running, and its very cool so far.
* some "Awesome" SSH tricks [here][2]
* article on RevSys on [SSH Tunneling made easy][3]
* Simple Deployment using [Git or Mecurial and DropBox][4]
* [Using Git and Dropbox together Effectively][5]
* [SSH Productivity tips][6]
* Not strictly Git, PowerShell or SSH related, but handy none the less: [Cool, but obscure, Unix tools][7]. Havent tried, but some should work with [Cygwin][8]
