title: Ubuntu, Screen, IRSSI, TTYTter, and anything else...
---
So, been playing around with the following... though i would post some links...

* [Ubuntu][1] my current choice of Linux... running on a VM on a dedicated server
* [GNU Screen][2] a really handy app for using multiple Termainl "Windows"... Also handy for resuming sessions...
* [IRSSI][3] IRC Client for *nix terminal... 
* [TTYtter][4] command line twitter client. 
* [Nano Text Editor][5] Using Nano as my text editor... Cannot get used to [VI][6] or [Emacs][7]... Giving up for the moment...
* [Putty][8] as my SSH client on Windows, SSH built into OSX on my Mac and [iSSH][9] on my iPhone and iPad.
* Still using GIT and Mercurial for different sites and projects. I also use [Dropbox][10] for some of my projects (see my [HowTo on using Dropbox with Mercurial and Git here][15], as well as [GitHub][11], [Kiln][13] and [BitBucket][12] for others. [FogBugz][14] Also comes in handy for project managment. Also, nice tip: if your in a small team (2 people or less....) or a student, and need hosting, checkout out [FogCreak's Offer][16]. Cant argue with FREE!

As i get more stuff, i will add it here.
