title: Magical Mystery Tour...
---

So, new project on GitHub called [Magical Mystery Tour][1]. 

Whats with the name? 
---------------------
For some reason, that song is in my head currently... so it will work as a project name... 

What is it?
------------
Idea is Simple... A C# EXE/Library that takes (or should take...) the files from [Jekyll][2] and build HTML output. If i do my job correctly, you should be able to move from any of the current blogs supporting Jekyll Migration (or should i say [Jekyll supports migration from][3]) and also use them with MMT (which i will call it from now...)

Why?
----
God only knows... Something to do i suppose...
