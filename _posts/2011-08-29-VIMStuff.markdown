title: VIM Stuff
---

VIM is one of those text editors that always scared me... It still does, but at least this [writeup][1] kind of explains it a lot more... 
Im used to Notepad, [NotePad++][2], [EditPad Pro][3] and [Visual Studio][4]. But, being a geek, i want to learn more... So, im trying out VIM (unsuccessfully currently) and Emacs, just to try them out...
